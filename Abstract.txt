				IMPLEMENTING BIPOLAR CODING SCHEME USING MATLAB

	Polar coding scheme is a type of line coding (a technique of converting digital data to digital signals). 
	In bipolar coding scheme a ‘0’ bit represents a ‘0’ voltage level and a ‘1’ bit represents an alternative voltage level,
		i.e if previously the voltage level was +1, now it would be -1 and if previously it was -1, now it would be +1.
